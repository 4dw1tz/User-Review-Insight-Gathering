# User-Review-Insight-Gathering
This repo contains a Python script that will go through the user reviews from an app and generate insight for the app creator. This is done by categorising each review into "positive", "negative", or "neutral". The insight will contain the distribution of reviews across these 3 categories so the creator knows how well the app is doing at a glance without having to look through all the reviews themself.

METADATA
The dataset is a comma separated document but imported to python as a text file.
Each line is a separate review
    Within each line there will be 2 values separated by a comma.
    The 1st value is the name of the app
    The 2nd value is the actual review
